# bec-coherence-time
Calculates the coherence time distribution of a Bose-Einstein condensate.


Markov sampling method (Metropolis sampling algorithm) for calculating the 
coherence time (distribution) of the order parameter for a given total particle number, 
temperature and trap frequency of a Bose-Einstein condensate.

For proper installation, please replace the path '/your-installation-path/' with your installation path in the lines 176 - 181 of this code.
